Fredric

* A python script made to join online classes automatically
* V1 is just the barebone script, lost the file
* V2 adds Tkinter GUI to the V1
* V3 is a cli based implementation of V1
* Moreover, V3 is used in a flask server that can be hosted locally, allowing me to join classes from my phone
* The flutter frontend for the phone is very incomplete, I have no idea how much I've done it, and it was one my first flutter code, don't judge it
